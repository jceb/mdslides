# slidesdown

Slideshows as fast as you can type Markdown.
[slidesdown](https://slidesdown.e-jc.de/loader.html) is powered by the
incredible [reveal.js presentation framework](https://revealjs.com/).

## Usage

### Online Viewer

Visit [slidesdown.e-jc.de](https://slidesdown.e-jc.de/loader.html) and enter the
URL to your markdown presentation in the loader form, e.g.
`github.com/jceb/slidesdown/SLIDES.md`.

### Create Slideshow (simple)

Create a markdown file in a publicly accessible place, e.g. in a
[github repository](https://github.com).
[reveal.js' additional formatting
options](https://revealjs.com/markdown/#element-attributes) can be used.

### Create Slideshow (advanced)

TODO: install the npm package locally and get a live preview and hot-reloading
while creating the slides.
