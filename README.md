Slideshows as fast as you can type.

[Slidesdown](https://slidesdown.e-jc.de) is powered by the incredible
[reveal.js presentation framework](https://revealjs.com/).

## Usage

Visit [slidesdown.e-jc.de/loader.html](https://slidesdown.e-jc.de/loader.html)
and enter the URL to your Markdown presentation, e.g.
`github.com/jceb/slidesdown/SLIDES.md`.

### Create Slideshow (simple)

Visit [slidesdown.e-jc.de/learn.html](https://slidesdown.e-jc.de/learn.html) to
get started.

### Create Slideshow (advanced)

TODO: install the npm package locally and get a live preview and hot-reloading
while creating the slides.
